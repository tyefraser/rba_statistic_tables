# to have the option as the first level. Then the 'dataset_yaml_name_list' as the second level.
# This is to only include the yaml file name (yaml_name.yaml) and NOT the full path (C://path/to/yaml.yaml), e.g:
# Option that the user will see displayed
#   - list of yaml files required to obtain data for that selection (from the specified yamls folder)
